# Kanban Discord Bot
 A (Python) Discord Bot specializing in Kanban Style Project Management- specifically engineered for discord server based start-up tasking.
 Please see the 'README' under the 'Main' Folder for directions on installing and utilizing this code in your own discord servers.

 The Kanban Discord Bot's goal is to reenforce the Six kanban practices to maximize productivity when accomplishing tasks...

    1. Visualize the workflow. The Kanban board visualizes a team’s workload in a way that’s easy to understand and execute.

    2. Limit work in progress. Restricting the number of tasks a team is working on at any given time helps maintain focus.

    3. Manage flow. This method switches the focus from managing people to managing a smooth flow of work.

    4. Make policies explicit. Keep them simple, visible, and easy to understand.

    5. Use feedback loops. Revisiting project goals regularly helps the team respond to changes and take advantage of new opportunities.

    6. Improve collaboratively. Teams with a shared vision can work together to achieve continuous improvement. These evolutions should be based on metrics and experimentation.
